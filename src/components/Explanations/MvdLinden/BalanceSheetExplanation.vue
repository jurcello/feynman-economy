      A reason for ambiguous explanations might be that balance sheets and T-accounts are often not used in analyses of the monetary and financial system. Non-economists but also most economist are not used taking a balance sheet perspective. Balance sheets are an objective way to study the current banking-based monetary and financial system, because banking is based on balance sheets, and, as said, corporate and central bankers use and think in terms of balance sheets themselves.

      This explanation of the functioning of onshore (domestic) banking is based on the explanations of bankers, i.e. economists with practical banking experience (Pozsar et al. 2010, 2013; Sheard 2013; Cliffe and Brosens 2014, 2018; McMillan 2014; McLeay et al. 2014a, 2014b; Lipton 2015; King 2016; Boonstra 2018; Boonstra and van Goor 2021) and uses colorful visualizations. In a next article offshore and international banking will be explained.
